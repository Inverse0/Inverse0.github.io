I am currently a final-year Master's student in Computer Science at Columbia University. My research primarily focuses on databases, data science, and computer networks. During my master's study, I am very fortunate to conduct research under the guidance of [Prof. Henning Schulzrinne](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/) and [Prof. Eugene Wu](http://www.eugenewu.net/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Economics at Boston University, under the mentorship of [Prof. Manos Athanassoulis](https://cs-people.bu.edu/mathan/).


Research Interests
------

My research focuses on the intersection of databases and systems, aiming to improve the efficiency and accessibility of large-scale data processing. My objectives include:

1. **Improving Data Access:** I explore how machine learning tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) can streamline data management processes to make high-quality data more accessible for diverse applications.

2. **Boosting Data Processing Speed:** I work on enhancing data processing tasks, like query processing, by leveraging hardware capabilities to optimize technologies for faster computations and robust real-time data analysis.

Through these endeavors, I seek to contribute innovative solutions that address critical challenges in data science and systems research.
