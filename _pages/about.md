I am currently a final-year Master's student in Computer Science at Columbia University. My research primarily focuses on databases, data science, and computer networks. During my master's study, I am very fortunate to conduct research under the guidance of [Prof. Kenneth Ross](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/), [Prof. Henning Schulzrinne](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/) and [Prof. Eugene Wu](http://www.eugenewu.net/). I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Economics at Boston University, under the mentorship of [Prof. Manos Athanassoulis](https://cs-people.bu.edu/mathan/).


Research Interests
------

My research focuses on the intersection of database management and Human-Data Interaction (HDI), aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of data insights driven by large-scale, complex datasets. My objectives include:

1. **Data processing:** Designing fast and reliable systems capable of processing large and intricate datasets.

2. **Data interpretation:** Integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and machine learning techniques with database systems to provide insightful, understandable interpretations of data.

3. **Trustworthy data system:** Enhancing the trustworthiness and reliability of data management and HDI systems through traceable and transparent data transformations.

Through these endeavors, I seek to contribute innovative solutions that address critical challenges in data management and HDI research.
